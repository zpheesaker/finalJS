### About this Project

*This react application is a showcase of some photographs of my family, my adventures, and some mountain scenery.
*The app has a header component which allows for users to navigate around the site, as well as a footer component that allows them to reach me via email.
*Every photo on the website was taken by me, or is of me. 
*The three pages: mountains, adventure, and family have photo galleries that allow users to click though the photos, or allow them to automatically go through. 
*Photos were taken in Wyoming, California, and Colorado.
*To start seeing the galleries, just select 'Family', 'Adventures', or 'Mountains' at the top of the screen.
